### Requirements for COVID-19

As a matter of public health and safety due to the pandemic, all members of the CU Boulder community and all visitors to campus must follow university, department and building requirements, and public health orders in place to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease. Required safety measures at CU Boulder relevant to the classroom setting include:

* maintain 6-foot distancing when possible,
* wear a cloth face covering (over nose and mouth), especially when unable to maintain a distance of at least 12 feet,
* clean local work area,
* practice hand hygiene,
* follow public health orders, and if sick and
	* you live off campus, do not come onto campus (unless instructed by a CU Healthcare professional), or
	* you live on-campus, please alert [CU Boulder Medical Services](https://www.colorado.edu/healthcenter/coronavirus-updates/symptoms-and-what-do-if-you-feel-sick).

Students who fail to adhere to these requirements will be asked to leave class, and students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to [Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/). For more information, see the policies on [COVID-19 Health and Safety](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/covid-19-health-and-safety-policy) and [classroom behavior](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) and the [Student Code of Conduct](http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/). If you require accommodation because a disability
prevents you from fulfilling these safety measures, please see the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus.


Before returning to campus, all students must complete the COVID-19 Student Health and Expectations Course. Before coming on to campus each day, all students are required to complete a Daily Health Form. In this class, you may be reminded of the responsibility to complete the Daily Health Form and given time during class to complete it.

Students who have tested positive for COVID-19, have symptoms of COVID-19, or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for or had symptoms of COVID-19 must stay home and complete the Health Questionnaire and Illness Reporting Form remotely. In this class, if you are sick or quarantined, please email me at chenhao.tan@colorado.edu to let me know that "you are absent due to illness or quarantine".
